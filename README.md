This tool is ideal for quickly obtaining summaries from verbal content, making it useful for note-taking, transcriptions, and more.

Features:
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words to text using the speech_recognition library.
Text Summarization: Summarizes the transcribed text using OpenAI's state-of-the-art language models.
Easy to Use: Simple command-line interface for recording speech and generating summaries.
Real-Time Processing: Provides near-instantaneous feedback and results.
Technologies Used
Speech Recognition: speech_recognition library
Text Summarization: OpenAI's GPT-3/4
Programming Language: Python
